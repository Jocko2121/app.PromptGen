# Project Plan: Phase 5

## Working Agreement
- **Approval:** 
  - Critical - The AI assistant will not write or modify any code without explicit user approval.
- **Clarification:** 
  - If the user asks a question or makes a comment after a proposal has been made, the assistant will answer the question and then *must* ask for approval again before proceeding to code. Answering a question does not imply approval to code.
- **Proposal:**
  - Before seeking approval, the assistant will provide a concise summary of the proposed changes, including which files will be modified.
- **Server**: 
  - The user will start and stop the server. You will request they do that on any code change that requires a server restart.
- **Task Completion**: 
  - Upon completion of a code change or task the assistant will provide a concise summary of the completed changes, including which files were modified and write out a clear UI test procedure (if necessary) for the user to follow.
