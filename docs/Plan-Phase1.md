- SQLite requires explicit type handling (e.g., boolean to number conversion)
- State persistence should be handled carefully to avoid data loss
- Testing tools should be kept for future development and debugging


## Revisit 1.5

### Task 3: Database Performance Monitoring Analysis

#### Current Implementation
- Basic health checks in server.js
- Database size monitoring in cleanup.js
- Simple connection verification

#### Proposed Implementation
- Add query execution time tracking
- Monitor slow queries (>100ms threshold)
- Track table growth over time
- Monitor index usage statistics
- Keep implementation lightweight and low-overhead

#### Benefits
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Guide optimization decisions
- Help with debugging
- Prevent performance degradation
- Provide data for future improvements

#### Implementation Approach
- Add timing wrappers around critical queries
- Log slow queries with context
- Track table sizes periodically
- Monitor index usage
- Keep overhead minimal

#### Recommendation: Keep (Simplified Scope)
- Focus on essential metrics only
- Avoid complex monitoring systems
- Keep implementation simple
- Prioritize debugging value over comprehensive monitoring

## Revisit 1.8

### Task 1: Integration Test Suite Analysis

#### Current Implementation
- Basic testing with Node's assert module
- Critical path tests
- Runtime data validation
- Test component creation page
- Database operation verification
- Error logging and debugging tools

#### Analysis
- Application architecture is straightforward:
  - Local-first application using SQLite
  - Components stored in single table
  - Simple state management
  - Minimal component interactions
- Current testing infrastructure already covers integration points:
  - test-database.html for database operations
  - test-api.html for API endpoints
  - Database constraints and triggers enforce integrity
  - Integrity checks in maintenance.js

#### Recommendation: Remove
- Redundant with existing testing infrastructure
- Application architecture is simple enough for unit tests
- Database constraints already enforce data integrity
- Existing test pages cover component interactions

### Task 2: End-to-End Testing Analysis

#### Current Implementation
- Individual component testing
- API endpoint testing
- Database operation testing
- No complete user flow testing

#### Critical User Flows
- Creating and modifying components
- Managing drafts in content blocks
- State persistence and recovery
- Backup and restore operations
- Project management (save/load/delete)

#### Complex State Management
- Auto-save functionality
- Manual save triggers
- State dirty flag management
- Multiple drafts per content block
- Project state persistence

#### User Interactions
- Adding/removing builder components
- Modifying component values
- Generating final prompts
- Managing drafts
- Theme switching
- Project management

#### Recommendation: Keep
- Current testing doesn't verify complete user flows
- Complex state management needs end-to-end verification
- Important user interactions span multiple components
- Critical for ensuring system reliability



# *Phase 2: Database Initialization & Component Management*

## Overview
The goal is to move from hardcoded components to a database-driven system while maintaining the app's core functionality. This involves:
1. Creating a database initialization process
2. Moving hardcoded components to a separate initialization file
3. Maintaining builderComponentData's structural role in the app

## Epic 2.1 - Database Initialization System
- [ ] Create database initialization process
  - [ ] Add database existence check in database.js
  - [ ] Create new database if none exists
  - [ ] Run migrations on new database
  - [ ] Add starter components from initialization file
- [ ] Create initialization file (src/db/initialization.js)
  - [ ] Move hardcoded components from builderComponentData to initialization file
  - [ ] Structure components for database insertion
  - [ ] Add validation for initialization data
- [ ] Add initialization error handling
  - [ ] Handle database creation failures
  - [ ] Handle migration failures
  - [ ] Handle component insertion failures
- [ ] Update server.js initialization sequence
  - [ ] Check database existence
  - [ ] Run migrations if needed
  - [ ] Run initialization if needed
  - [ ] Start state persistence

## New Files Required
- `src/db/initialization.js`: Contains starter components and initialization logic
  - No other new files needed
  - All other functionality uses existing files

## Files to Modify
1. `src/db/database.js`
   - Add database existence check
   - If no database exists, run starter-components.js to create one
   - No other changes needed

2. `src/server.js`
   - Update initialization sequence
   - No other changes needed

3. `public/index.html`
   - Remove hardcoded components from builderComponentData
   - Keep component structure
   - No other changes needed

4. `src/routes/api.js`
   - Update `/starter-components` endpoint to read from database
   - Add proper error handling for database failures
   - No other API endpoint changes needed

5. `src/services/state-persistence.js`
   - Add database readiness check before loading state
   - Update initialization sequence
   - No other changes needed

6. `src/db/starter-components.js`
   - Move all default components from builderComponentData to this file
   - This file will be the source of truth for new database creation
   - No other changes needed

## Scope Boundaries
- No changes to existing database structure
- No changes to existing UI behavior
- No changes to existing backup/restore functionality
- No changes to other API endpoints
- No changes to state persistence core functionality

## Important Notes
- Starter components will be moved to database
- Database must be properly initialized before app can start
- No fallback to hardcoded components - database must be working
- starter-components.js is the source of truth for creating a new database
- Simple process: check for database → if none exists → run starter-components.js

## Epic 2.2 - Component Structure Management
- [ ] Maintain builderComponentData structure
  - [ ] Keep component type definitions (role, task, format, etc.)
  - [ ] Keep component titles
  - [ ] Keep prompt structure definitions
  - [ ] Remove hardcoded prompt values
- [ ] Update component rendering
  - [ ] Modify renderBuilderPallet to use database for prompt values
  - [ ] Update component state management
  - [ ] Ensure UI remains consistent

## Epic 2.3 - Testing & Verification
- [ ] Add initialization testing
  - [ ] Test database creation
  - [ ] Test component insertion
  - [ ] Verify component structure
- [ ] Add component validation
  - [ ] Verify component types
  - [ ] Verify component relationships
  - [ ] Test component modifications

## Important Notes
- builderComponentData remains in index.html but only contains structure, not values
- Component values come from database, structure comes from builderComponentData
- Initialization only happens once when database is first created
- All components (including "starter" ones) are treated equally in the database
