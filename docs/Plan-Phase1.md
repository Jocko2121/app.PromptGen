## **Notes**
- Phase 2 focuses on system enhancement and optimization
- Items are organized by functional area
- Implementation order may be adjusted based on user needs and system performance


## **Important Context & Lessons Learned**
- All decisions and changes are discussed and approved before implementation
- Minimal dependencies to avoid bloat and compatibility issues
- Express was chosen after careful consideration and explicit approval
- All setup steps are documented for reproducibility
- Project is designed for local-first, but with an eye toward future expansion
- SQLite requires explicit type handling (e.g., boolean to number conversion)
- State persistence should be handled carefully to avoid data loss
- Testing tools should be kept for future development and debugging


## Revisit 1.5

### Task 3: Database Performance Monitoring Analysis

#### Current Implementation
- Basic health checks in server.js
- Database size monitoring in cleanup.js
- Simple connection verification

#### Proposed Implementation
- Add query execution time tracking
- Monitor slow queries (>100ms threshold)
- Track table growth over time
- Monitor index usage statistics
- Keep implementation lightweight and low-overhead

#### Benefits
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Guide optimization decisions
- Help with debugging
- Prevent performance degradation
- Provide data for future improvements

#### Implementation Approach
- Add timing wrappers around critical queries
- Log slow queries with context
- Track table sizes periodically
- Monitor index usage
- Keep overhead minimal

#### Recommendation: Keep (Simplified Scope)
- Focus on essential metrics only
- Avoid complex monitoring systems
- Keep implementation simple
- Prioritize debugging value over comprehensive monitoring

## Revisit 1.8

### Task 1: Integration Test Suite Analysis

#### Current Implementation
- Basic testing with Node's assert module
- Critical path tests
- Runtime data validation
- Test component creation page
- Database operation verification
- Error logging and debugging tools

#### Analysis
- Application architecture is straightforward:
  - Local-first application using SQLite
  - Components stored in single table
  - Simple state management
  - Minimal component interactions
- Current testing infrastructure already covers integration points:
  - test-database.html for database operations
  - test-api.html for API endpoints
  - Database constraints and triggers enforce integrity
  - Integrity checks in maintenance.js

#### Recommendation: Remove
- Redundant with existing testing infrastructure
- Application architecture is simple enough for unit tests
- Database constraints already enforce data integrity
- Existing test pages cover component interactions

### Task 2: End-to-End Testing Analysis

#### Current Implementation
- Individual component testing
- API endpoint testing
- Database operation testing
- No complete user flow testing

#### Critical User Flows
- Creating and modifying components
- Managing drafts in content blocks
- State persistence and recovery
- Backup and restore operations
- Project management (save/load/delete)

#### Complex State Management
- Auto-save functionality
- Manual save triggers
- State dirty flag management
- Multiple drafts per content block
- Project state persistence

#### User Interactions
- Adding/removing builder components
- Modifying component values
- Generating final prompts
- Managing drafts
- Theme switching
- Project management

#### Recommendation: Keep
- Current testing doesn't verify complete user flows
- Complex state management needs end-to-end verification
- Important user interactions span multiple components
- Critical for ensuring system reliability
