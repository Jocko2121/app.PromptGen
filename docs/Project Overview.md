# Project: AI Prompt Generator


## New Session Prompt
I need you to do a full analysis of the app to enable you to deeply understand how the site works as a whole. It is especially important that you understand how the database is used, the various components, prompt sets, appState, event listeners, tabs and the Database Components page functions. After your analysis is complete, read the md files in the /docs directory to understand the history, targeted user (single person local app) and what our options are for next steps. The additional notes below will aid you in understanding the context we will be working in.

## Purpose and Use Case for App
- **Purpose:**
  - A local-first, single user, Node.js-based AI Prompt Generator app that runs on a Users localhost server.
  - Allows users to create, manage, and save prompt projects for LLMs (Large Language Models).
  - Designed for personal/local use, but code will be open for others to self-host.
- **Frontend:**
  - Modern, single-page app (SPA) with a sidebar, project library, and prompt builder.
  - All UI logic and state management handled in the browser (index.html, CSS, JS).
  - No images or binary dataâ€”text only.

## Working Agreement
- **Approval:** 
  - Critical - The AI assistant will not write or modify any code without explicit user approval.
- **Clarification:** 
  - If the user asks a question or makes a comment after a proposal has been made, the assistant will answer the question and then *must* ask for approval again before proceeding to code. Answering a question does not imply approval to code.
- **Proposal:**
  - Before seeking approval, the assistant will provide a concise summary of the proposed changes, including which files will be modified.
- **Server**: 
  - The user will start and stop the server. You will request they do that on any code change that requires a server restart.









## *2. Features & Architecture*

### UI/UX Structure and Guiding Principles
- The app is a state-driven, single-page application (SPA). All UI is rendered from a central `appState` object.
- Uses modern CSS (variables, flexbox, grid) for responsive, themeable design.
- Supports both dark and light modes via CSS variables and a toggle button.
- Main layout: sidebar (prompt library, jobs, projects) and main content area (panels for project hub, prompt builder, refinement, text transformer, article workspace).
- Sidebar is collapsible and contains quick access to jobs, project library, and an admin reset button (to be removed later).
- All interactive UI elements (buttons, selectors, textareas) are styled for clarity and accessibility.
- Collapsible panels for organization and focus (Prompt Builder, Refinement, Text Transformer, Article Workspace).
- Draft system for all major content blocks, allowing multiple versions and easy switching.
- All state changes are handled in-memory in the browser, with the intention to periodically persist to backend storage.

### Data Model and State Management
- **Single Source of Truth:** The `appState` object contains all application data.
- **Project Model:**
  - Each project has a unique ID, name, active job, builder config, content blocks, and text transformer state.
  - Projects are stored in `appState.savedProjects` (array), with the current project in `appState.activeProject`.
- **Builder Components:**
  - Configurable components: role, task, job, audiencePro, audienceSilly, format, tone, length, pov, context, constraints.
  - Each component can be active/inactive, has a selection, prompt value, and user value.
  - Predefined prompt templates for each component (see `builderComponentData` in code).
  - Visual differentiation between starter and modified components:
    - Starter components use default styling
    - User-modified components have distinct background color and optional visual indicators
    - Styling changes are managed through CSS variables for easy theming
    - Transition effects for smooth visual feedback when components are modified
  - Database Structure:
    - Starter components stored as static JSON in codebase (read-only)
    - User components table structure:
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE user_components (
          id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
          original_starter_id TEXT,  -- references the starter component it was based on
          component_type TEXT,       -- role, task, job, etc.
          is_active BOOLEAN,
          selection TEXT,
          prompt_value TEXT,
          user_value TEXT,
          created_at TIMESTAMP,
          modified_at TIMESTAMP
      );
      ```
    - When a user modifies a starter component:
      1. New record created in user_components
      2. Original starter component referenced
      3. User modifications stored
      4. Visual styling updated to indicate modified state
- **Content Blocks:**
  - userOutline, finalPrompt, articleWorkspace, textTransformerInput, textTransformerOutput.
  - Each block has an array of drafts (id, timestamp, content) and an activeDraftId.
- **Text Transformer:**
  - Supports actions: summarize, rewrite, analyze (with sub-options for each).
  - Stores active action and options for each action.
- **Draft System:**
  - All major text areas support multiple drafts, with save/delete and active draft selection.
  - Drafts are timestamped and uniquely identified.
- **State Persistence:**
  - Currently in-memory only (per code comments), but designed for periodic save/load to backend.
  - Hybrid persistence strategy:
    - Auto-save:
      - Periodic background saves of general application state
      - Triggers every 30 seconds or after period of inactivity
      - Acts as safety net against data loss
      - Saves current state of all components, drafts, and settings
    - Manual saves:
      - Required for specific user actions:
        - Modifying starter components
        - Creating new custom components
        - Explicit project saves
        - Creating backups
        - Exporting data
      - Provides explicit user control for important changes
      - Ensures critical modifications are intentionally saved
  - Backup and Restore System:
    - Backup Management:
      - Maintains last 3 backups (configurable)
      - Each backup stored as timestamped SQLite file (e.g., `backup_2024_03_20_15_30.db`)
      - Stored in dedicated `backups/` directory
      - Automatic cleanup of oldest backup when limit reached
    - Backup Triggers:
      - Manual: User-initiated backup through UI
      - Automatic: Daily system backup
      - Skips backup if no changes since last backup
    - Restore Process:
      - User can switch between available backups
      - Before restore:
        1. Current state is automatically saved as a backup
        2. User can preview backup contents
        3. Confirmation required before restore
      - After restore:
        - System reloads with restored state
        - User notified of successful restore
    - Logging:
      - All backup/restore operations logged
      - Success/failure status tracked
      - Timestamps recorded for all operations

### Notable Design Decisions and Patterns
- **All UI state is derived from a single JS object (`appState`), making it easy to serialize/deserialize for persistence.**
- **Component-based rendering:** Each major UI section has its own render function, which reads from `appState` and updates the DOM.
- **Event delegation:** Main event listeners are attached to container elements and use event.target to determine action, reducing the number of listeners.
- **Extensible builder model:** New builder components or prompt templates can be added by extending the `builderComponentData` and `jobTemplates` objects.
- **Draft system is generic and used across all major content blocks, supporting versioning and undo.**
- **Theme support is built-in and easily extendable.**
- **Admin reset and project management features are first-class, supporting robust user workflows.**

### Useful Comments and Patterns from Code
- The code is heavily commented, especially around architecture and data model.
- Comments clarify that the current version is in-memory only, but the structure is ready for persistent storage.
- The builder and content block models are designed for flexibility and future expansion.
- UI logic is separated from data/model logic, making it easier to refactor or port to a framework if desired.



## *3. Technical Decisions & Rationale*
- **Node.js**: Chosen for backend due to familiarity, ecosystem, and ease of local hosting.
- **Express**: Used for serving static files and simple API endpoints. Chosen for future flexibility, minimal overhead, and wide support.
- **better-sqlite3**: Chosen for database. Reasons:
  - File-based, zero-config, perfect for local use
  - Easy to upgrade to more robust DB later if needed
  - Supports JSON storage for app state
- **No images/binary data**: All data is text, so storage and performance are not concerns.
- **Folder structure**: Designed for clarity, scalability, and best practices (see below).
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only Express and better-sqlite3 (plus nodemon for dev, if desired).
- **Testing Strategy**:
  - Development Testing:
    - Use Node's built-in `assert` module for basic tests
    - Test critical paths only (database operations, backup/restore)
    - Keep tests simple and close to the code
    - No separate test servers or complex setups
  - Runtime Testing:
    - Basic data validation in database operations
    - Simple error logging to text file
    - Backup file integrity checks
    - No complex monitoring systems
  - Testing Focus Areas:
    1. Database Operations:
       - Component saving/loading
       - State persistence
       - Data integrity
    2. Backup System:
       - Backup creation
       - Restore process
       - File integrity
    3. Error Handling:
       - Basic error logging
       - Recovery procedures
